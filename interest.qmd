### 1. Community-Based Psychological Research

Humans are evolutionarely grounded for community-based lifestyles. Social intimacy has shown to improve mental and physical health. Yet, individualized living has sent us toward isolated living.

Increasing diverity has played a role in recent trends of isolation.

Placing more funding into personalizing neighborhoods that would build a new group identity for which people can embody.

### 2. Teaching Statistics in the Social Sciences

*Inspiring teachers are like summer camp counselors. Realistically, they might seem worlds apart, but they share a crucial trait: they are both excellent storytellers. Inspiring teachers unravel complex topics through stories, enabling their students to form emotional connections with the lessons. They focus on more than just imparting knowledge; they empower students to apply imaginative thinking in the classroom. Inspiring teachers build a nurturing space where students feel encouraged to explore and question.*

*The storytelling approach has been a cornerstone of my teaching philosophy, helping me inspire many of my peers in college. After developing this skill as a summer camp counselor for seven years, I continued to weave stories into my lessons as a statistics tutor. For instance, I would take a subject like hypothesis testing and create vivid scenarios, expressing the researchers' thoughts and dilemmas with their datasets.*

*This approach might seem unconventional, but it has proven highly effective. By using characters and real-life examples, I helped my colleagues transform the often dry principles of statistics into vivid, engaging narratives. It added color to the traditional, monotonous format of lecturing about functions and distributions. This method particularly resonated with literature-driven students in the social sciences, allowing them to forge deeper connections with statistical concepts.*

*My experiences have led me to believe that storytelling is not just a tool but a bridge that connects abstract concepts with tangible understanding. I am eager to bring stories that elucidate key statistical concepts and to inspire every student I meet with an enthusiastic drive. By doing so, I hope to create a lasting impact on their academic and professional journeys.*
