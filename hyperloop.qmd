title: "Measuring Perceptions of the Hyperloop"
---

# Project Description

*My primary research objective at Hardt Hyperloop was to investigate user perceptions of a simulated hyperloop trip. The company aimed to determine the appropriate dimensions of the hyperloop capsule before investing extensively in materials. However, since the company had not yet developed a hyperloop accessible to the public, predicting how people would feel inside the capsule was challenging. To address this, our team designed a real-life hyperloop experience---a wooden mock-up capsule equipped with seating and accompanied by a VR headset to illustrate the remaining characteristics of the hyperloop interior.*

*We recruited residents in Groningen to participate in the VR simulation and complete questionnaires. Four main constructs---technology acceptance, perceived safety, perceived comfort, and claustrophobia---were identified for latent class analysis. This model will be instrumental in classifying users in future simulated hyperloop studies.*

### Step 1: Install and load necessary packages

``` r
install.packages("poLCA")
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(poLCA)
library(ggplot2)
```

### Step 2: Prepare your data

*The dataframe named* `survey_data` *contains columns:* `tech_acceptance`, `perceived_safety`, `perceived_comfort`, *and* `claustrophobia`. *Unfortunately, due to privacy laws, I cannot share the data on this platform. I can only provide my code for analyzing the survey data collected at Hardt Hyperloop.*

### Step 3: Specify the LCA model

``` r
survey_data <- cbind(tech_acceptance, perceived_safety, perceived_comfort, claustrophobia) ~ 1
```

### Step 4: Run the LCA for different numbers of classes and compare models

``` r
# Fit the models with different numbers of classes
set.seed(123) # For reproducibility
lca_models <- list()
aic_values <- numeric()
bic_values <- numeric()

for (nclass in 1:4) { 
  lca_model <- poLCA(formula, data = survey_data, nclass = nclass, maxiter = 1000, na.rm = TRUE)
  lca_models[[nclass]] <- lca_model
  aic_values[nclass] <- lca_model$aic
  bic_values[nclass] <- lca_model$bic
}

# Compare models using AIC and BIC
comparison <- data.frame(
  Classes = 1:5,
  AIC = aic_values,
  BIC = bic_values
)

print(comparison)
```

### Step 5: Plot AIC and BIC for model comparison

``` r
ggplot(comparison, aes(x = Classes)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = AIC, color = "AIC")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = BIC, color = "BIC")) +
  geom_point(aes(y = AIC, color = "AIC")) +
  geom_point(aes(y = BIC, color = "BIC")) +
  labs(title = "Model Comparison", y = "Criterion Value", x = "Number of Classes") +
  scale_color_manual(name = "Criteria", values = c("AIC" = "blue", "BIC" = "red")) +
  theme_minimal()
```

### Step 6: Select the best model based on AIC/BIC and interpret parameters

``` r
# Select the best model (assuming the lowest BIC is preferred)
best_nclass <- which.min(bic_values)
best_model <- lca_models[[best_nclass]]

# Summary of the best model
summary(best_model)

# Print class probabilities
print(best_model$P)

# Print item-response probabilities
print(best_model$probs)
```

### Step 7: Graph the item-response probabilities for the best model

``` r
# Create a data frame for plotting
item_probs <- data.frame(
  Class = rep(1:best_nclass, each = length(best_model$probs[[1]])),
  Variable = rep(names(best_model$probs), each = best_nclass),
  Level = rep(1:length(best_model$probs[[1]]), best_nclass),
  Probability = unlist(lapply(best_model$probs, function(x) unlist(x)))
)

# Plot item-response probabilities
ggplot(item_probs, aes(x = Level, y = Probability, fill = factor(Class))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  facet_wrap(~ Variable, scales = "free_y") +
  labs(title = "Item-Response Probabilities by Class", x = "Response Level", y = "Probability") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1", name = "Class") +
  theme_minimal()
```
