title: "Climate Activism"

*Climate change is the most essential topic to discuss right now since it affects every aspect of our life, from the environment and economy to health and society. We must act soon since the situation is grave, and I believe that everyone can contribute to the cause. As an activist, I wish to contribute to the solution by advocating for policies and techniques that promote sustainability and environmental justice.*

### My Journey

*I was just twelve years old when I began my path as a climate activist. The first time I learnt about global warming, it sparked a passion in me that has only gotten stronger with time. I grew captivated with its science and promised myself to learn more about its effects. All of my school writings concentrated around this critical issue.\
\
One of my first projects was to create a floating windmill, which I entered in a competition at the local university. This not only sparked an unwavering interest in renewable energy, but also demonstrated how ingenuity and creativity can be used to solve environmental challenges. This endeavor was the catalyst for my full-fledged involvement in climate advocacy.*

### Virginia Tech Climate Action Committee

*As a member of the Virginia Tech Climate Action Committee, I was able to collaborate directly with university administration, teachers, and students to create and execute ways to reduce the campus's greenhouse gas emissions. Our endeavors included energy-efficient construction projects, environmentally friendly transit choices, and significant educational campaigns. This program refined my policy-making and collaborative problem-solving abilities while also demonstrating the crucial role that academic institutions play in tackling climate change.*

### Representing at COP25

*Being a student delegate at COP25 marked a pivitol point in my advocacy. Attending the United Nations Climate Change Conference gave me a global perspective on the climate situation and the many methods that countries are adopting. Meeting with officials, scientists, and other activists from around the world was both motivating and eye-opening. It strengthened my confidence in the value of international collaboration and the critical necessity for collective action to combat climate change.*

### Environmental Psychology and Hardt Hyperloop

*Continuing my study, I earned a master's degree in Environmental Psychology, where I used my talents and experiences to better understand the human aspects of environmental concerns. My research at Hardt Hyperloop was focused on sustainable transportation solutions, namely novel approaches to cut carbon emissions in the transportation industry. This study was both hard and enjoyable, and it reinforced my confidence in the necessity of incorporating psychological insights into environmental efforts to promote sustainable habits and practices.*

### The Scientist Rebellion

*Joining the Scientist Rebellion was a bold step that demonstrated my dedication to climate justice. This movement, made up of scientists fighting for bold changes to solve the climate crisis, allowed me to combine my scientific training with activism. We hoped that by holding peaceful protests and public rallies, we might put pressure on governments and companies to pursue more aggressive climate action. This experience helped me better appreciate civil disobedience as a tactic for social change, as well as the crucial role that scientists play in the climate movement.*

### Expanding Activism

*My advocacy has also taken me beyond climate change and into the Free Palestine cause. The connection between environmental justice and human rights has pushed me to broaden my involvement. Advocacy for Palestine has expanded my knowledge of global justice by demonstrating that genuine sustainability requires social equality and human dignity. This larger viewpoint has reminded me that the battle for a fair and sustainable society is multidimensional and interdependent.*

### Reflecting on My Journey

*My engagement in these many aspects of climate advocacy has greatly influenced who I am now. Each event taught me vital insights about the intricacies of the climate catastrophe and the varied solutions required to address it. Creating the VTCJ Foundation showed me the value of community and grassroots initiatives. My work with the Virginia Tech Climate Action Committee emphasized the significance of institutional transformation. Representing at COP25 gave a global perspective, while engaging in Scientist Rebellion highlighted the importance of bold, direct action.*

*Looking ahead, I am more determined than ever to continue working with groups dedicated to climate change. I want to use my experiences to inspire and motivate others, creating a culture of sustainability and resilience. Working together, we can build a future in which renewable energy is the norm, ecosystems are preserved, and all communities live in harmony with the environment.\

Thank you for showing interest in my climate advocacy. I hope that my path motivates you to take action in your own manner. Together, we can make a difference.*
